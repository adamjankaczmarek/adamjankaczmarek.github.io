- name: "CellStar Algorithm"
  logo: /images/sections/projects/poleval2021.png
  role: Researcher / Developer
  timeline: "August 2012 - March 2017"
  repo: "http://cellstar-algorithm.org"
  summary: "Automatic tracking of cells in time-lapse microscopy is required to investigate a multitude of biological questions. To limit manipulations during cell line preparation and phototoxicity during imaging, brightfield imaging is often considered. Since the segmentation and tracking of cells in brightfield images is considered to be a difficult and complex task, a number of software solutions have been already developed.
CellStar is one of such algorithms. It is optimized to segment and track images of budding yeast cells growing in monolayer (e.g. images from microfluidic chambers), however the algorithm can be also used to track other round objects (in brightfield as well as fluorescent images)."
